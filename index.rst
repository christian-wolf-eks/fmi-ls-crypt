Test Project documentation
==========================

.. Add your content using ``reStructuredText`` syntax. See the `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_ documentation for details.

Based on the `FMI 2.0.2 standard <https://fmi-standard.org>`_, this layered standard defines a way to sign FMUs cryptographically.
That way, the users of FMUs can create trust in the simulation models implemented and their authenticity.
